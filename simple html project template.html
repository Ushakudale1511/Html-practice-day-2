    For customer convenience, features such as a wish list, easy returns, and a live chat support system are essential. Implementing secure payment gateways with options for credit/debit cards, digital wallets, and EMI plans can cater to diverse customer preferences. Finally, ensuring that the website is mobile-friendly and optimized for fast loading times across all devices will enhance the user experience, encouraging repeat visits and purchases.</p>
